    <p class="two">
      A browser is a program on which a user can gain information which is on
      the World Wide Web. A user uses a browser to gain access to things such as
      videos, images etc. The browser is technically a program that allows a
      user to access information online. (Contributor, 2019). The browser works
      as a client which is available on the users device. The user then puts in
      a request to the web server and the request is then sent back and
      displayed as the information that the user asked for. (Contributor, 2019).
      Browsers are therefore presented in everyday apps that we have on our
      laptops or phones such as Safari on iPhone and Google or Chrome on any
      desktop of laptop.Through Browsers users have unlimited access to all
      sorts of information made available on teh World Wide Web.
