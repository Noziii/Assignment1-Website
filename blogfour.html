            My website has gone through a tremendous amount of changes this
            quarter. Most of which were last-minute changes, I had to change a
            lot of the aesthetic of my page at the start of the quarter my
            website looked more like a website for makeup or photography. Which
            is not what I was aiming for I then had to change it to fit the
            message I am trying to put across to whoever views my website. And
            that is trying to sell me as a web developer, my target audience
            needs to understand the type of person I am by just viewing my
            website and the way in which elements on my site are organized or
            designed. But also making sure that my website is easy to navigate,
            and that text is easy to read. Important text is written in bold
            enough letters to make them eligible to, viewers. I struggled a bit
            with developing good UI and UX although I got a few of my friends at
            home to navigate through my website without being told what to press
            and where to press. The site itself is easy enough to understand.
            But this could be based on their previous experience with most
            websites as the setup is no different. What I struggled with a lot
            was my portfolio page. Where I implemented a picture overlay but for
            the second picture the overlay is rendering outside the image and
            that does cause a malfunction in the site. For the most part, the
            process was rather stressful and one that I had underestimated
            because a large deal of consideration and thought goes into a
            website. At first glance, a website might look simply but it is a
            very taxing process, where you can spend hours trying to fix the
            position, width, and height of an image.
